### The CLEAR Method for Software Development

The CLEAR method offers a shared language between entrepreneurs, engineers, and AI. It defines how your product behaves before anyone writes a line of code. It replaces chaos with structure:

Context → Layout → Execute → Assess → Run

The CLEAR method is a structured, prompt-driven approach for iteratively developing an application. Each step in the process is initiated by a specific, well-defined prompt to ensure clarity and traceable outputs.


## Structured Prompts for Each Phase

The following prompts correspond to the nodes and steps detailed in the flowchart below:

| Phase/Node | File Output | Prompt  |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| C (Requirements) | prd.md | 'Create a product requirements document called prd.md for a modern AI chat application called Zen Chat that allows users to have real-time conversations with multiple AI models like GPT-4o.' |
| L (Architecture) | stack.md | 'Based on the @prd.md and @design.html, create a technical stack and architecture document called stack.md.' |
| L (TDD Plan) | plan.md | 'Create plan.md as a phased TDD implementation plan for @prd.md using @stack.md and @design.html' |
| L (Test Plan) | test.md | 'Create test.md as a test plan matching the phases in @plan.md. Make sure that each phase ends in human-verifiable outputs.' |
| E (Implement) | None | 'Implement phase X of the @plan.md' |
| A (Test/Report) | phase_X_report.md | 'Execute test in phase X of the @test.md and write phase_X_report.md' |
| C (Update) | None | 'Update the @stack.md, @plan.md and or @test.md according to Five Whys to prevent the mistake in the future' |
| E (Remediate) | None | 'Remediate phase_X_report.md.' |
| R (Run) | None | 'Ship!' |

## The CLEAR Method Flowchart

This flowchart shows the continuous integration and delivery loop, emphasizing the iterative nature of the development process.
